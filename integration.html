            <p>After getting residence permit, you can already start taking Dutch lessons while you are still at the COA location. You will be registered at a municipality (In Dutch: Gemeente) where you will get a house. The official integration (In Dutch: Inburgering) starts once your Plan Inburgering en Participatie (PIP) is made at your municipality. You have three years to get the diploma. Integration is compulsory. There are 3 different routes for integration:</p>

            <h1>Z-Route</h1>
            <p>Z-route is self-sustainability route. This route is for those people who are generally old and uneducated people. They are unable to pass the B1 Dutch exam. So, they just need to attend the regularly classes for at least 800 hours during three hours. They can also apply for the B1 exam if they are willing to do so. But it is not mandatory for them. Sometimes they are asked to do voluntary work to get involved in the society.
